description: Python style and quality rules
---

- Follow **PEP 8** strictly
- Use **Black** formatting
- Prefer **Ruff** rules over flake8/pylint
- Use `snake_case` for variables/functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Add **type hints** whenever possible
- Functions should be short and focused
- Public modules and functions MUST have docstrings
- Avoid deeply nested logic
- Prefer explicit code over clever code
